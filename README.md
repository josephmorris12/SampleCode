# SampleCode
This is some of my sample code.
This directory holds a variety of python scripts I have used to retrieve data from files, automatically make the files, and do statistical analysis on course-grained molecular dynamic peptide simulations. The actual files that they do analysis on are not included because I figured it would be to much of a pain to download multiple gigabytes of data to run a couple of scripts. Also, my lab is publishing a paper using this data soon, so it would not be a good idea to post it. Moreover, a lot of these scripts require downloading a lot of packages and placing scripts in a bunch of different directories so it would probably take a while to set up. If you want to see some of these scripts in action during an interview, along with the actual molecular dynamic trajectories running in ChimeraX I would be more then happy to show them off.
